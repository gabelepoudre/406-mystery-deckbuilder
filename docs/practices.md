Provides a (somewhat) verbose guide as to the expected practices when developing. Do your best to follow everything here, unless explicitly labelled as optional

## Git

### Workflow
We will be using a VCS workflow called "Trunk-based" development. For those of you with experience with GitFlow (feature branches), be aware
that this is not the same. Where GitFlow creates deep branch patterns such as main->dev->feature_XxXx, the focus of Trunk-based is 
to have a single "main" branch and to only create single short lived branches off of the main branch.
